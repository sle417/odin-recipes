        <li>2 cups ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves for garnish (optional)</li>
      </ul>

        <h2>Instructions:</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground Italian sausage (or sausage and ground beef) over medium heat until browned. Drain any excess fat.</li>
        <li>Add the diced onion and minced garlic to the skillet and cook until the onion is translucent.</li>
        <li>Stir in the tomato paste and crushed red pepper flakes, and cook for 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, diced tomatoes, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper. Simmer the sauce for 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, 1 cup of grated Parmesan cheese, and a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a lightly greased casserole dish.</li>
        <li>Place a layer of lasagna noodles on top of the sauce, followed by a third of the ricotta cheese mixture, a third of the meat sauce, and a third of the shredded mozzarella cheese. Repeat this layering process two more times.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the remaining ½ cup of grated Parmesan cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Cover the dish with foil and bake for 30 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna rest for 10-15 minutes before serving. Garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired.</li>
      </ol>
